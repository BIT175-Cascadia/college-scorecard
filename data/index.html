            <p>While there is variation in the amount of debt and fraction of students borrowing by sector, on average, <span class="insight-highlight">students at private for-profit two-year and four-year institutions have high rates of borrowing and their graduates often have large amounts of debt.</span> While debt per se may not be problematic where students are able to repay their loans, it should be paired with other data, such as completion rates and post-school earnings, to provide a more comprehensive picture of student outcomes.</p>

          <p>Loan repayment rates offer a new way to consider borrower behavior, and may convey more information about student debt management than cohort default rates (CDR). The overall three-year repayment rate for all undergraduate institutions, weighted by the number of students borrowing at each school, was 45 percent in the combined 2010 and 2011 repayment cohorts. <span class="insight-highlight">55 percent of borrowers were thus not meeting the repayment rate metric - either they were in default or were making monthly payments that were not reducing their loan balance.</span> As a point of comparison, the three-year CDR was 13 percent for all students in the 2011 repayment cohort.</p>

            <p>There is a great deal of earnings variation within a college, so that students with good outcomes at low-earning schools often perform better than students with poor outcomes at high-earning schools. Earnings variation can be explained at least in part by the program in which students choose to study; <span class="insight-highlight">program-level earnings data will be available moving forward, beginning with the 2012 cohort.</span></p>

            <p><span class="insight-highlight">The data in the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) on enrollment intensity and transfer status are both of poor quality for Pell-only students prior to 2012.</span> Because of this, the data do not support reporting completion rates disaggregated by full-time and part-time status, or first-time and not-first-time status. Moreover, since transfers can only be identified if the student receives Title IV aid at the transfer-in institution, NSLDS cannot reliably identify all transfer students.</p>

            <p>To help complement federal data and address the limitations of the federal graduation rate measure collected through IPEDS, <span class="insight-highlight">several external organizations have launched efforts to measure accurate completion rates and other data sources.</span> One effort, the Student Achievement Measure, provides data on progress and completion of transfer, part-time, and full-time students. The Voluntary Framework of Accountability explores remedial education, academic measures, and workforce outcomes. Additionally, IPEDS will begin collecting and publishing more comprehensive graduation rates next year.</p>

      <h2>Data Documentation</h2>

      <p>The College Scorecard is designed to increase transparency, putting
        the power in the hands of the public &mdash; from those choosing
        colleges to those improving college quality &mdash; to see how well
        different schools are serving their students. This documentation
        provides more on how to use the data, including:</p>
